So, let's code a Spotify clone with react-native

The first step you have to config your environment to support react-native. React-native
has a very good documentation. For this project, we will use the react-native-cli.

* Set up the environment with react-native: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

Once you have installed everything, you can start the project. Run this command on your terminal:

```
npx react-native init SpotifyClone --template react-native-template-typescript  
```
